:edl.

:p.3. Distribution Obligations.

:p.3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain
such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner
on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

:p.3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License.
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant
the rights conveyed by this License.

:p.3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your
Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent
or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

:p.3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and
to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and
not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer.

:p.3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
such terms You offer.

:p.3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

:p.4. Versions of the License.

:p.4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license
steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
:p.4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

:p.4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by the license
steward.

:p.4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You
may create and use a modified version of this License if You:
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
the license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

:p.5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE
IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

:p.6. TERMINATION.

:p.6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

:p.6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging
that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software
where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and
all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
agreement with Participant.

:p.6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
termination.

:p.7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO
LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

:p.8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that
term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial
computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or
other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in
computer software under this License.

:p.9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

:p.10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and
the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on
an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

:p.----------------------------------------------------------------

.br
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
.br
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

:p.[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]

.ce Preamble

:p.The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

:p.This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

:p.When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

:p.To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

:p.For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

:p.We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

:p.To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

:p.Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

:p.Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

:p.When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

:p.We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

:p.For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

:p.In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

:p.Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

:p.The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
:p.

.ce GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
.ce TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

:p.0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

:p.A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

:p.The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

:p."Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

:p.Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

:p.1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

:p.You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

:p.2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

:dl tsize=3 break=none.
:dt.a)
:dd.The modified work must itself be a software library.
:dt.b)
:dd.You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
:dt.c)
:dd.You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
:dt.(d)
:dd.If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.
:edl.

:p.(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)

:p.These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

:p.Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

:p.In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

:p.3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

:p.Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

:p.This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

:p.4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

:p.If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

:p.5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

:p.However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

:p.When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

:p.If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

:p.Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

:p.6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

:p.You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

:dl tsize=3 break=none.
:dt.a)
:dd.Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)
:dt.b)
:dd.Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
:dt.c)
:dd.Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.
:dt.d)
:dd.If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.
:dt.e)
:dd.Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
:edl.

:p.For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

:p.It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

:p.7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

:dl tsize=3 break=none.
:dt.a)
:dd.Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.
:dt.b)
:dd.Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
:edl.

:p.8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

:p.9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

:p.10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

:p.11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

:p.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

:p.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

:p.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

:p.12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

:p.13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

:p.Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

:p.14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
:p.
.ce NO WARRANTY

:p.15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

:p.16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
:p.
.ce END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
:p.
.ce How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

:p.If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

:p.To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

:xmp.
    &lt.one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt.
    Copyright (C) &lt.year&gt.  &lt.name of author&gt.

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
:exmp.

:p.Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

:p.You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

:xmp.
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  &lt.signature of Ty Coon&gt., 1 April 1990

.* ............................................................................
:h3 res=712 name=pdf_types_in_general
    x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100%.En general

Los archivos PDF (Portable Document Format) caen por lo general en una de estas
tres categor¡as&colon.

:ul compact.
:li.®verdaderos¯ o creados digitalmente: el documento tiene su origen en un
procesador de textos u otra aplicaci¢n que genera texto e/o im genes como
salida ®impresa¯;
:li.digitalizaci¢n o de imagen: el documento es esencialmente una fotograf¡a
(o conjunto de ellas) de un documento f¡sico, y se presenta como archivo de
imagen; o
:li.mixto: un documento que comenz¢ como imagen pero fue procesado a posteriori
para reconocer el texto contenido en las im genes e incorporarlo como elemento
susceptible de b£squedas.
:eul.

:p.Los formularios son variantes del primer tipo, y pueden dividirse en otro
conjunto de categor¡as. Para una discusi¢n m s detallada de los formularios
PDF, por favor consulte m s tarde :link reftype=hd res=720.Formularios
PDF:elink..

:p.Actualmente, :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. puede representar estos tres tipos
principales de archivos PDF, con algunas excepciones. El rango de formularios
procesables se ampl¡a con cada versi¢n, sin embargo, de modo que en alg£n
momento Lucide deber¡a deber¡a poder mostrar correctamente todos los tipos de
PDF, incluidos aquellos menos comunes que pueden causar alg£n problema en la
actualidad.

.* ............................................................................
:h3 res=714 name=pdf_fonts
    x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100%.Fuentes: inclusi¢n y sustituci¢n

Un PDF verdadero puede gestionar las fuentes de una o m s de las siguientes
formas&colon.

:ul compact.
:li.sustituci¢n, que hace que Lucide muestre ®al vuelo¯ una imagen general
utilizando la informaci¢n del documento sobre los caracteres;
:li.inclusi¢n, en la que todos los caracteres necesarios para representar una
fuente se incluyen en el propio documento;
:li.inclusi¢n parcial, en la que s¢lo se incluyen en el documento los
caracteres de las fuentes que aparecen en el mismo.
:eul.

:p.Puesto que una fuente puede constar de miles de caracteres, incluir s¢lo los
caracteres realmente utilizados en cada documento espec¡fico redundar  en
archivos de tama¤o m s peque¤o, lo m s deseable normalmente.

:p.Normalmente, la sustituci¢n produce los tama¤os de archivo m s peque¤os; sin
embargo, puede causar problemas para el archivado de documentos u otras
situaciones en las que se necesita absoluta fidelidad al material original. Las
fuentes no est ndar o, por ejemplo, los s¡mbolos matem ticos pueden no mostrarse
lo bastante fidedignamente para una representaci¢n adecuada de los datos.

:p.La inclusi¢n almacena las fuentes enteras en el documento PDF, lo que
normalmente produce los mayores archivos, si bien los m s fieles al material
original.

:p.La inclusi¢n parcial proporciona un equilibrio entre tama¤o de archivo y
fidelidad, puesto que representa exactamente todos los caracteres utilizados en
el documento, mientras se minimiza el espacio que se desperdiciar¡a en el documento
dedic ndolo a caracteres y fuentes que no se utilizan.

:p.El m¢dulo PDF incluido con :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. utiliza la :link refid=poppler
reftype=fn.biblioteca de c¢digo externa ®Poppler¯:elink. para mostrar los
documentos PDF. Poppler, a su vez, utiliza la misma :link refid=fontconfig
reftype=fn.biblioteca Fontconfig:elink. que las aplicaciones Mozilla actuales
para realizar sustituci¢n de fuentes por nombre, de modo que se puedan
seleccionar fuentes alternativas apropiadas para los documentos que no incluyen
fuentes.

:p.Dependiendo de las fuentes instaladas en el sistema actualmente, algunas
fuentes sustitutas pueden funcionar mejor que otras. Fontconfig hace una
determinaci¢n razonable al seleccionar una fuente alternativa; sin embargo, la
selecci¢n disponible es clave. Tener un conjunto de fuentes robusto en el
sistema puede suponer la diferencia entre un documento legible o uno al que le
falte contenido o sea dif¡cil -si no imposible- de leer.

:p.Adem s de mostrarlos, deber¡a tenerse en cuenta que la b£squeda global de
texto en :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. s¢lo es posible en documentos PDF verdaderos o
mixtos, en los que hay texto como tal disponible para realizar b£squedas. Esto
no es posible con los PDFs de tipo imagen.

®PDF¯ es el t‚rmino com£n utilizado para describir todos los archivos de tipo
Portable Document Format; sin embargo, hay cierto n£mero de subdivisiones de
dicha tecnolog¡a y :link refid=iso_32000-1 reftype=fn.el propio est ndar
PDF:elink. ha sufrido muchos cambios a lo largo de su historia.

:p.Los documentos PDF ®est ndar¯ (que cumplen la norma ISO 32000-1) se deber¡an
poder leer con :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. de forma general. Estos documentos permiten la
inclusi¢n y sustituci¢n de fuentes; sin embargo, pueden incluir algunos
elementos XFA (XML Forms Architecture) que a£n no se manejan bien en Poppler y,
por extensi¢n, :hp2.Lucide:ehp2.. Para una discusi¢n m s detallada de los
formularios PDF, por favor consulte m s tarde :link reftype=hd
res=720.Formularios PDF:elink..

:p.:link refid=iso_19005 reftype=fn.PDF/A:elink. es un subconjunto de PDF que
intenta eliminar ciertos riesgos a la fidelidad documental. Por ejemplo, PDF/A
no permite el contenido din mico (fuentes u otros medios sustituidos), lo que
lo convierte en la elecci¢n id¢nea para mantener archivos. Todos los datos
necesarios para representar el documento se incluyen est n contenidos en el
archivo PDF/A, incluidos fuentes, perfiles de color, im genes, etc.

:p.:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. deber¡a manejar los documentos PDF/A como cualesquiera
otros, aunque los PDF/A tienden a ser de mayor tama¤o que algunos otros y
por tanto tardan m s en cargarse y necesitan mayor potencia de proceso para
examinarse.

:p.:link refid=iso_24517-1 reftype=fn.PDF/E:elink., otro subconjunto de PDF, se
proyect¢ para documentaci¢n t‚cnica y de ingenier¡a. Se basa en la PDF Reference
versi¢n 1.6 de Adobe Systems y soporta medios interactivos, incluidas im genes
3D y animaci¢n.

:p.:link refid=iso_14739-1 reftype=fn.PRC:elink. (Product Representation
Compact) se define dentro de PDF/E-2 como un formato de archivo de alta
compresi¢n para contenido 3D, proyectado para incluirse en documentos PDF y
otros formatos similares orientados al intercambio y representaci¢n 3D. Se
puede utilizar para crear, ver y distribuir datos 3D en flujos de trabajo de
intercambio de documentos. Est  optimizado para almacenar, cargar y mostrar
varias clases de datos 3D, especialmente los que vienen de sistemas de dise¤o
asistido por ordenador (CAD: computer aided design).

:p.:link refid=ecma-363 reftype=fn.U3D:elink. es otro formato de archivo
comprimido que se puede utilizar desde PDF/E. U3D publicado y mantenido por
ECMA International como ECMA-363.

:p.:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. deber¡a poder abrir los documentos PDF/E 2D como se
espera, aunque no se podr  reproducir el contenido multimedia. De la misma
forma no se representar n los archivos 3D incluidos en formato U3D ni PRC.
Adem s s¢lo se representar  una capa de los documentos PDF/E multicapa.

:p.:link refid=iso_14289-1 reftype=fn.PDF/UA:elink. (Universal Access) ofrece
accesibilidad para gente con discapacidades que utiliza lectores de pantalla,
lupas para pantalla, joysticks, etc. para examinar y leer documentos
electr¢nicos.

:p.:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. es capaz de mostrar el contenido textual de los documentos
PDF/UA, aunque actualmente :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. carece de cualquier tipo de
mecanismo para pasar los datos a un lector de pantalla, por ejemplo.
:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. interpreta el texto de un documento PDF/UA como un gran
enlace y el puntero del rat¢n ser  siempre la mano :artwork runin
name='hand.bmp'.&per.

:p.:link refid=iso_16612-2 reftype=fn.PDF/VT:elink. (Variable y Transactional)
se define sobre PDF/X-4 y PDF/X-5, utilizando PDF 1.6. Es el primer formato de
impresi¢n de datos variables (VDP: variable-data printing) que asegura una
gesti¢n moderna del color :link refid=icc reftype=fn.basada en ICC:elink.
utilizando ICC Output Intents. A¤ade el concepto de grupos de objetos gr ficos
encapsulados para soportar el procesamiento optimizado de contenido textual o
de im genes repetido. A trav‚s de metadatos de partes de documentos (DPM:
Document Part Metadata) se puede lograr una gesti¢n din mica y fiable de
p ginas para datos de impresi¢n de alto volumen de salida transaccional (HVTO:
High Volume Transactional Output), p.e. selecci¢n de registros u optimizaci¢n
de portes basadas en tales metadatos.

:p.PDF/VT-1 siempre consiste en un £nico archivo autocontenido, aunque otras
variantes del est ndar permiten contenido gr fico externo (PDF/VT-2), y los
PDF/VT-2s ofrecen transmisi¢n de datos en tiempo real mediante el uso de
paquetes MIME compuestos. Tales documentos se pueden compartir, mostrar o
navegar de forma interactiva utilizando programas visores de PDF est ndar
(tales como :hp2.Lucide:ehp2.), aunque la verdadera fidelidad requiere
programas que cumplan con PDF/X-4 o PDF/VT (una versi¢n futura de Poppler
puede ser totalmente conforme).

:p.Debido a la naturaleza completamente encapsulada de los documentos PDF/VT-1,
:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. puede mostrarlos fielmente, aunque de los PDF/VT-2 (y, por
extensi¢n, PDF/VT-2s) s¢lo se mostrar  el documento seleccionado
actualmente y no ninguno de sus componentes documentales externos enlazados.
Esto puede abordarse en una versi¢n futura de Poppler.

:p.:link refid=iso_15930 reftype=fn.PDF/X:elink. se parece a PDF/A en que
tambi‚n debe contener datos encapsulados; sin embargo, puesto que el principal
prop¢sito de PDF/X es gestionar el intercambio de gr ficos, tiene algunas
necesidades relacionadas con la impresi¢n que van m s all  del  mbito de los
PDFs est ndar. Adem s de encapsular im genes, cuando son conformes con la
especificaci¢n PDF/X-1a (basada originalmente en PDF 1.3, con la actualizaci¢n
de 2003 basada en PDF 1.4), tales im genes deben ser en cuatricrom¡a o colores
directos. Los colores calibrados CIELAB o RGB son aceptables para la
conformidad con PDF/X-3 (basado en PDF 1.4), aunque permanecen la mayor¡a de
los otros requisitos de PDF/X-1a. (Nunca se lleg¢ a publicar PDF/X-2.)

:p.PDF/X-4 ofrece soporte de datos de color gestionado, cuatricrom¡a, gris,
tricrom¡a, o color directo, adem s de transparencia y contenido opcional en los
que los datos est n contenidos en el archivo. Se utiliza un segundo nivel de
conformidad (PDF/X-4p, basado en PDF 1.6) para designar un documento PDF/X-4 en
el que se suministra externamente un perfil ICC necesario que se identifica de
forma un¡voca.

:p.PDF/X-5 (basado en PDF 1.6) permite que se incluyan todos los datos, o donde
se haya previsto que se identifique de forma un¡voca y se suministre
externamente contenido gr fico o perfiles ICC de n colorantes. Este est ndar se
actualiz¢ en 2010 con peque¤as correcciones que no alteraron la especificaci¢n
original.

:p.PDF/X-5 ofrece tres niveles de conformidad&colon.

:ul.
:li.PDF/X-5g&colon., que extiende PDF/X-4, habilitando el uso de contenido
gr fico externo (flujos de trabajo estilo interfaz de preimpresi¢n abierta: OPI,
u Open Prepress Interface). M s espec¡ficamente, pueden referenciarse gr ficos
externos al PDF que ®pueden tener valor al... reducir... las exigencias...
permitiendo... trabajar a baja resoluci¢n¯ [ISO-15930-8&colon.2010].

:li.PDF/X-5pg&colon., que extiende PDF/X-4p, habilitando el uso de contenido
gr fico externo junto a una referencia a un perfil ICC externo a la salida
buscada.

:li.PDF/X-5n&colon., que extiende PDF/X-4p, habilitando un perfil ICC
suministrado externamente a la salida buscada para usar un espacio de color que
no sea escala de grises, tricrom¡a RGB o cuatricrom¡a CMYK.
:eul.

:p.Los documentos PDF/X tambi‚n deben incluir un archivo especial de
identificaci¢n que especifique con qu‚ nivel de PDF/X son conformes. Un archivo
dado s¢lo puede ser conforme con un £nico est ndar PDF/X.

:p.:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. deber¡a ser capaz de abrir documentos PDF/X as¡ como
PDF/A, ya que el contenido encapsulado deber¡a tener soporte completo en

:h2 res=720 name=pdf_forms
    x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100%.Formularios PDF

Los archivos PDFs cumplimentables son principalmente de dos tipos&colon.

:ul.
:li.AcroForms, creados generalmente con las versiones de Adobe Acrobat 4.x
hasta 7.x
:li.Basados en formularios XFA (XML Forms Architecture), desarrollados por
Accellio, que fue absorbida despu‚s por Adobe. Estos documentos almacenan la
estructura de datos XML dentro del archivo PDF y ahora son el m‚todo est ndar
de crear documentos PDF con formularios. Adobe LiveCycle Designer 7.x o m s
reciente, as¡ como las versiones de Acrobat posteriores a 7.x crean formularios
basados en XFA.
:eul.

:p.:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. es capaz de manejar ambos tipos de formularios PDF,
aunque conviene adoptar algunas precauciones. Al guardar los datos de un
formulario a un documento basado en XFA, la biblioteca Poppler que
:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. utiliza los almacena en el archivo PDF y :hp2.Lucide:ehp2.,
al detectar cambios en el archivo original, pregunta al usuario si guardar el
archivo bajo otro nombre.

:caution.Volver a editar el formulario guardado anteriormente har  que los
nuevos datos se almacenen con los antiguos, que no se eliminan del archivo.
Esto puede representar un riesgo de seguridad. Por este motivo se recomienda
encarecidamente guardar datos s¢lo en formularios PDF sin usar previamente, en
vez de simplemente reutilizar un formulario ya existente, cumplimentado total o
parcialmente, y editar los datos introducidos.:ecaution.

Otros tipos relacionados de documentos para manejar datos en formularios son
FDF (Forms Data Format) y XFDF (XML Forms Data Format). Actualmente
:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. no permite trabajar con ninguno de estos al no d rseles
soporte en Poppler.

:p.Las versiones m s recientes de Acrobat tambi‚n pueden emplear elementos
JavaScript en un documento PDF para cosas tales como listas desplegables y
otros datos de presentaci¢n condicional. Actualmente :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. no
reconoce estos tipos de campos, aunque puede mostrar fielmente el resto del
documento e incluso permitir introducir datos en los dem s campos de los
formularios. Se recomienda no utilizar :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. para estos documentos.
Esta limitaci¢n puede abordarse en versiones futuras de la biblioteca Poppler.

documentos de este tipo&colon.

:ul.
:li.Contrase¤as cifradas
:li.Certificados de seguridad
:li.Encapsulado PDF seguro
:li.Permisos
:eul.

:p.Las contrase¤as para abrir documentos PDF (generalmente conocidas como
contrase¤a del propietario) se cifran actualmente con algoritmos :link
refid=rc4 reftype=fn.RC4:elink. de 10 o 128 bits (considerados d‚biles seg£n
los est ndares de hoy incluso en su variante de 128 bits) o, en los documentos
creados con versiones m s recientes de Acrobat u otras herramientas, :link
refid=aes reftype=fn.AES:elink. de 128 o 256 bits.

:p.Se puede utilizar certificados digitales (elaborados por uno mismo o por
terceros fiables) para cifrar (con los mismos algoritmos disponibles para el
uso de contrase¤as) o ®firmar¯ documentos digitalmente. Dichas firmas digitales
se consideran legalmente vinculantes en muchas jurisdicciones.

:p.Actualmente, :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. no tiene forma de manejar los certificados de
seguridad, aunque los documentos firmados con un identificador (ID) digital se
pueden leer (y mostrar su firma y sello digitales) siempre que no hara sido
tambi‚n cifrado con un certificado.

:p.Los encapsulados o sobres PDF seguros son esencialmente grupos de archivos
encapsulados en (o m s bien, adjuntados a) un archivo PDF que sirve como
contenedor (o p gina de cubierta). Se puede entonces proteger el encapsulaado
mediante contrase¤a y opcionalmente firmarlo y proteger con contrase¤a tambi‚n
el contenido.

:p.Si el encapsulado no est  cifrado o est  protegido con contrase¤a,
:hp2.Lucide:ehp2. podr  abrir el propio encapsulado PDF. Sin embargo, el
contenido, o archivos adjuntos &mdash.que pueden ser de cualquier tipo&mdash.
no ser n accesibles.

:p.Los permisos incluyen restricciones a la impresi¢n y copia del contenido
(al portapapeles del sistema o guardando el documento en otro archivo), as¡
como permitir acceso a lectores de pantalla, etc.

:p.Los permisos de un documento se establecen en el archivo PDF en el momento
de su creaci¢n y soslayar sus restricciones normalmente necesita una contrase¤a
aparte. La biblioteca Poppler que :hp2.Lucide:ehp2. utiliza ignora tales
restricciones y no solicita que se introduzca la contrase¤a para hacerlo.

:fn id=rc4.
RC4 (Cifrado Rivest 4), una vez conocido por su elegancia y velocidad, ha sido
relegado a la inutilidad como m‚todo de cifrado fuerte. Es particularmente
vulnerable cuando no se descarta el inicio de la salida del flujo de datos de
las claves, o las claves utilizadas carecen de un nuivel suficente de entrop¡a.
Se recomienda que no se utilicen los cifrados RC4 (ni siquiera de 128 bits) si
la seguridad constituye una verdadera preocupaci¢n.

:fn id=aes.
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), o Rijndael, desarrollado por los dos
cript¢grafos belgas Joan Daemen y Vincent Rijmen, fue adoptado por el Instituto
Nacional de Est ndares y Tecnolog¡a de Estados Unidos (NIST) en 2001 como FIPS
PUB 197 (FIPS 197).

:p.El NIST utiliza tres cifrados diferentes para el AES, cada uno con un tama¤o
de bloque de 128 bits, pero con tres longitudes de clave diferentes (128, 192 y
256 bits).

:p.El algoritmo descrito por AES tiene simetr¡a de clave (es decir, se utiliza
la misma clave para cifrar y descifrar los datos).

:p.En la actualidad AES se considera el mejor medio de encriptar datos para su
transmisi¢n en tr nsito o en almacenamiento.
