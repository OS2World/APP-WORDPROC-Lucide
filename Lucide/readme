  - http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?key=UClip

Optional: to have japanese fonts working you need poppler-data pack.

  - extract the 4 directories from the package found on http://poppler.freedesktop.org
    to your %unixroot%/usr/local/share/poppler or to the dir where lucide.exe is installed
