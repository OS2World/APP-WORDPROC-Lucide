:: Known problems/limitations ::

General: even/odd printing unavailable for postscript printing.
          ( http://svn.netlabs.org/lucide/ticket/87#comment:4 )

General: currently, Lucide determines the document type by extension, so
         files without extensions are not supported yet.
          ( http://svn.netlabs.org/lucide/ticket/43 )

General: files with more than one dot in the filename are not displayed in
         the Open File dialog. This is not a Lucide problem, but a problem
         of the standard Open File dialog.
          ( http://svn.netlabs.org/lucide/ticket/86#comment:1 )

PDF plugin: text selection in multicolumn documents may work incorrectly
            and Lucide may even crash. It's a problem of poppler PDF rendering
            library.
             ( http://svn.netlabs.org/lucide/ticket/98 )

$next              - will switch to next page
$switchfullscreen  - will switch to fullscreen (even if minimized)
$minimize          - will mimimize Lucide (even if fullscreen)
