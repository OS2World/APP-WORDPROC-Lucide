:: Comparison to qPDFView ::

Both Lucide and qPDFView utilize the poppler library for rendering PDFs.
Internal differences between the two program result in some rendering more
quickly in one program vs the other. Overall, we feel that Lucide has a more
OS/2-like - or native - feel to its interface, and is better suited to the
operating system. Lucide also supports native OS2 printers while qPDFView 
requires CUPS The choice is left entirely to the user as to which is
better suited to his needs.

:: Requirements ::

To install all prerequisites in one go from Arca Noae Package Manager, simply
copy and paste the following string into the Quick install dialog:

    libc libcx libgcc1 libgcc-fwd libstdc++6 libsupc++6 poppler poppler-data libjpeg djvulibre uclip GBMDLL

If you prefer the yum command line, please type

    yum install libc libcx libgcc1 libgcc-fwd libstdc++6 libsupc++6 poppler poppler-data libjpeg djvulibre uclip GBMDLL

and press <Enter>.


Specifically, Lucide requires the following:

  - libc 0.6.6:
    - http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/libc-0_6_6-38_oc00.zip (zip format)
      or ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0_6_6-csd6.wpi (WarpIn format)
      or "yum install libc" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
  - libcx 0.6.3
    - http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/libcx-0_6_4-1_oc00.zip (zip format)
       or "yum install libcx" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
  - gcc492.dll:
    - ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/gcc4core-1_3_1.wpi (WarpIn format)
      or "yum install libgcc1 libgcc-fwd" (from the netlabs-rel repository)

For rendering PDFs, Lucide's plugin requires the following:

    - poppler 0.59.0:
    - "yum install poppler" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
    
For rendering DjVu files, Lucide's plugin requires the following:

    - djvulibre 3.5.27:
    - "yum install djvulibre" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
    
For rendering multiple bitmap format files (GBM), Lucide's plugin 
requires the following:

    - GBMDLL 1.76:
    - "yum install GBMDLL" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
    - Installed by default on ArcaOS 5.0.3 and higher

For rendering JPEGs, Lucide's plugin requires the following:

    - libjpeg 8d:
    - "yum install libjpeg" (from the netlabs-rel repository)
    - Only needed if you install the JPG plugin GBM provides JPG support
    - You should not install  JPG and GBM at the same time. (GBM is recommended)

Optional: to place unicode text to the clipboard in OpenOffice.org-compatible
format you need to install UClip package (enhanced OS/2 clipboard support,
installed by default in eComStation 2.0 RC1 and up, as well as ArcaOS Blue
Lion):

    - http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?key=UClip
      or "yum install uclip" (from the netlabs-rel repository)

Optional: to have Japanese fonts working you need the poppler-data package.

    - "yum install poppler-data" (from the netlabs-rel repository)

Note: If you install Lucide during the ArcaOS install all these packages
are installed.

PostScript printing requires PostScript-capable printer (pscript.drv or
psprint.drv).

$next              - will switch to the next page
$presentation      - will switch to presentation (even if minimized)
$minimize          - will mimimize Lucide (even if fullscreen)
$rotate            - will rotate 90ï¿½ CW
$zoomin            - will zoom in
$zoomout           - will zoom out
$zoomoriginal      - will zoom to the actual size

This can be useful for presentations with a remote control.
