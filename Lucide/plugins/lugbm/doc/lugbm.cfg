# Defines the scaling algorithm

#
# By default the simple scaler is used. This is the fastest scaler which uses
# less resources compared to all other scalers. Though it provides acceptable
# quality for normal viewing.
scaler=simple

# Defines the number of pages of a multipage image that should be
# calculated in background for faster drawing (costs more memory).
# Always progressive_render_pages/2 pages backward and forward will
# be calculated in background.
